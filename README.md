# ActiveModel::Errors API Redesign Initiative

Let's make a more OO, more flexible error API!

---

Sometimes [ActiveModel::Errors API](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Errors.html) cannot cope with complex business logic or requirements elegantly.

This repo aims to collect the inconveniences you have faced, and allow you to suggest a better, more usable API.

Currently we are at the initial stage [wiki editing], mainly to:

1. Collect use case
2. Design API


[So come to our wiki, see what's going on, and join us!](https://github.com/lulalala/rails_error_api_redesign/wiki)


The second stage will then start on 1st July 2017, where we can discuss on how to implement the redesigned API. Maybe we can do it in Rails, maybe we can do a 3rd party library. We shall see!
