# AdequateErrors

Renamed from Rails Error API Redesign Initiative

Let's make a more OO, more flexible error API!

---

As requirements get more complex, Rails' error API often cannot cope with them elegantly.

This repo aims to collect the inconveniences you have faced, and allow you to suggest a better, more usable API.

The project takes place in both the wiki and the git repo itself.

In the wiki we:

  1. Collect use case
  2. Design API

In the git repo we implement that interface:

  1. Implement standalone interface to access AdequateErrors.
  2. Write a bridge so official Rails errors states can be reflected in AdequateErrors


[So come to our wiki, see what's going on, and join us!](https://github.com/lulalala/rails_error_api_redesign/wiki)


The second stage has began, where we start implementation, feel free to give a PR.
