# Rails Error API Redesign Initiative

Let's make a more OO, more flexible error API!

---

As requirement gets more complex, Rails' error API often cannot cope with those requirements elegantly.

This repo aims for you to share the inconveniences you faced, and suggest a better, more usable API.

Currently we are at the first stage, where activities happen mostly on WIKI, where we:

1. Collect use case
2. Design API on wiki

[SO COME AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND JOIN US ON THE WIKI](https://github.com/lulalala/rails_error_api_redesign/wiki)


The second stage will start on 1st July 2017, where we can discuss on how to implement the redesigned API. Maybe we can do it in Rails, maybe we can do a 3rd party library. We shall see!
